# Dialogue-Feature-Extraction-Pipeline-Using-Function-Calling

## overview

This project is designed to build a dialogue feature extraction pipeline, focusing on extracting key information from customer support dialogues. The extracted information includes agent name, customer email, customer order, customer phone, and customer sentiment. This information is stored in a SQLite database, which can be queried to gain insights about the dialogues.
